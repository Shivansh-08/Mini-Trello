## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher recommended)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or a MongoDB Atlas account)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd mini-trello
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

You need to create a `.env` file in both the `server` and `client` directories.

1.  **Backend `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `server` directory (`/server/.env`) and add the following, replacing the placeholders:

    ```env
    PORT=5001
    MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
    JWT_SECRET=yourrandomjwtsecretkey
    ```

2.  **Frontend `.env` file:**
    Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with `VITE_`. Create a file named `.env` in the `client` directory (`/client/.env`) and add the following:

    ```env
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need two separate terminal windows to run both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    * In your first terminal, navigate to the `server` directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm start
        ```
    * The server should be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    * In your second terminal, navigate to the `client` directory:
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm run dev
        ```
    * The frontend application should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
